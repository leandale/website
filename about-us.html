                    <p>
                        At LeanData<sup>TM</sup>, we are focused on making our customers more successful by solving the garbage-in/garbage-out paradigm of enterprise data. We believe enterprises cannot make data-driven business decisions if they do not trust the quality of their data.
                        <br/><br/>
                        The name LeanData is derived from the core idea behind lean manufacturing, lean software development, and lean startups - maximizing customer value while minimizing waste. In order to manage a lean enterprise today, you must start by making sure your data is lean by eliminating the dirty data that's wasting your time and preventing you from focusing on customers.
